 <h5>   Fortnite began as a multiplayer shooter focused on narrative-driven mode where you and some friends fought against hords of quirky enimies. It had a distinctive personality but failed to attract a wider audience. This changed with the arrival of Pubg and the wider adoption of battle royale. Epic games saw an opportunity to twist their underwhelming shooter in a battle royale clone and grasped it, and it hasn't looked back since. The first few words were very simplistic, the signs of a thrown together products rather obvious before millions of players began arriving, keen to master this addictive new formula. It didn't take long for Fortnite's popularity to explode, With Epic games introducing regular seasons and battle passes each with their own bespoke aeathetic, themes and approach to in-game storytelling. At the time it was hugly innovative, pioneering that are now adopted by some of gaming's biggest names. It's influence can be felt everywhere in 2020, Which is a testament to how Epic Games has shaped and grown this curious experiment into somthing seeming unstoppable. </h5>

          
  <h4>Yo Number Two </h4>
           
           <h1>2. CALL OF DUTY</h1>

    <img src= "COD.jpg" />

  <h5>       Bring a multiplayer shooter game to handheld devices is always a tricky business. 
We all have concerns when our favourite console game comes on mobile. So what i'm trying to say is that Call of Duty Mobile or COD Mobile is everything we wanted and even more. The marketing itself of Call Of Duty Mobile was very dope. Unlike the Call Of Duty series' classic dark and intense trailers. COD Mobile had flashy, vibrant and thematic trailers, this is merely a Call of duty conversion to mobile setup. Instead Call of Duty Mobile is a reimagination of Call Of Duty for mobile phones. So what i'm trying to say is that it is a game designed for smartphones and it still has the usual Call of Duty map, weapons and modes. The controls are easy to understand yet take your time and get a grip on it. Well the game starts with a detailed tutorial with Simon Riley (GHOST) Well Pro players might get angry with the tutorial because of how long and frustrating the tutorial is. The first multiplayer mode is a basic first-person shooter game. Well It provides well and balanced matchmaking, it puts you against people that match your battle level. Battle royale is a grand battlefield with maximum of a 100 soilder's. The player's can choose to be a lonewolf in a two-man game or four soilder squad. The soilders enter a plane with just one weapon. The arena has gear's and veichle's at different places, and the player's must reach and upgrade themselves. The safe zone on the map deacreases as the game progresses.

<h5>       PUBG Mobile undoubtedly one of the best Android multiplayer games. Even though the game was banned in India, It has since been relaunched under the banner of Battlegrounds Mobile India, so you don't have to worry about missing out on any PUBG fun. Yo dudes get this you can actually play with a 100 players in the field also known as battle royale. 100 players get dropped on an island to gather weapons and be the last man standing or Squad standing. </h5>

  <h4>
   For Number Four We got

    <h1>
 4. Free Fire
</h1>

 <div class= "picture2">
<img src= "Free Fire Max.jpg" />
 </div>

   <h5>
             To say that Garena Free Fire is quite popular is an understatement. It is among the five best battle royale games available today across platforms, with a battle royale game of 100 daily active players. The game was originally released in 2017 and has grown since then. Over the years, there have been quite a number of additional content released, bringing it with a fresh take on the game, most which are based on time-limited collaborations. Well the graphics of Free Fire is Okay but there are times while playing it just becomes a blur or when it is about to finish matching you with players it just automatically quits on its own, but the special events and craftland is worth it just like a world called BloodWing City.

Last but not Least we got

        <h1>
5. Among Us
         </h1>

  <img src= "Among Us.jpg" />

      <h5>

      After the release of Among Us, it seems the golden period of Android gaming had arrived. One of the highest games ever played it surpassed some popular games like Fall Guys and has been topping charts across the world. It's an online multiplayer game with unique social deduction theme. By the way, the game can also be played over local WIFI with 4 to 10 players.

      Coming to gaming theme, here you prepare your spaceship for departure along with other teammates, but bear in your mind, bear that there is an imposter among you who wants to kill everyone. The imposter blends in with the remaining of the crewmates to build trust, but sooner chaos ensures you as you find a dead body of one of your teammates. You have to try and find the imposter before he kills you.
